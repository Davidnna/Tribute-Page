                <p>Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and author widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time. His work laid the foundations for classical mechanics, and his *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* introduced the laws of motion and universal gravitation. Here is a brief timeline of his remarkable life:</p>

                    <li>1687: Published <i>"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica,"</i> laying the foundation for classical mechanics.</li>
                    <li>1703: Became the president of the Royal Society.</li>
                    <li>

                            <li>1665-1667: Developed the laws of motion and universal gravitation during the Great Plague.</li>
                            <li>Invented the reflecting telescope.</li>
                            <li>Advanced calculus and mathematical physics.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Died:</strong> March 31, 1727, in Kensington, London at the age of 84.</li>
